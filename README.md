# Laboratiorio de Practias

Laboratiorio de Practicas para el desarrollo de habilidades congitivas, matem√°ticas y razonamiento verbal.

This project does not include any external node packages, only tools from the framework such as Image, Navigation, Link, usePathname and more were used. 

Please be aware before adding any nodepackages and check compatibility with React and Next.js versions. 

Before updating the project styles, read the tailwind.config.ts file since there are custom colors, screens and fonts to consider in the design.

For further improvements I recommend to add error boundaries, loading animations to the content, improve how some ecuations display in the topics, and
the abstraction of components into smaller reusable ones, since there is repetitive code in some buttons and small structures. 

If for any reason fetching data from a back-end becomes necessary in the future, Next.js is suitable to create endpoints for that data. I recommend reading the documentation for that: [API Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. If that port is occupied, in the terminal you will get an available port to use. 

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

However, this project was deployed in own server.
